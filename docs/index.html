    <h1>HW1 Submission</h1>
    <p>
        In this class, i am looking to gain a lot of the basic skills needed for web development for a couple
         of reasons. The <strong>first</strong> reason is that i have always thought that the field of web development has been very
         interesting and so <em>finally</em> getting to learn more than basic html is something i have wanted to do for awhile.
         The <strong>second</strong> main thing I want to get experience in different types of programming beyond object oriented programming, which is the majority 
         of the programming i have done before, so branching into a different style of programming i think will help me develop new skills. Other than that, i am taking this as an elective for my major as well, so i hope to get
         a decent amount out of this class.

        function msgFunc() {
            document.getElementById("msg").innerHTML = "Button Clicked!";
        }
        var btn = document.getElementById("btn");
        btn.addEventListener("click", msgFunc)
    </script>
